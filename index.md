ðŸ“œ In mathematics, a meromorphic function is smooth and well-behavedâ€”except at isolated singularities where it breaks down completely. Science, life, human experience, and the universe are largely intelligible â€” yet punctuated by deep, personal, or universal mysteries that defy resolution. Meromorphy is a space for exploring those surfaces and those singularities â€” with clarity, curiosity, and respect for what remains unknown.
