ðŸŒ€ Meromorphy â€” Almost understood. Beautifully broken.

ðŸ“œ In mathematics, a meromorphic function is smooth and well-behavedâ€”except at isolated singularities where it breaks down completely. This blog is shaped by the same truth: that science, life, and human experience are largely intelligible, yet punctuated by deep, personal, or universal mysteries that defy resolution. Meromorphy is a space for exploring those surfaces and those singularities â€” with clarity, curiosity, and respect for what remains unknown.
