In mathematics, a meromorphic function is something that behaves—well, almost perfectly. It’s smooth, logical, and beautifully structured until it’s not. At certain isolated points, called poles, the function just loses its cool and shoots off to infinity. These aren’t flaws exactly. They’re part of the design. A meromorphic function is allowed to break, but only in very specific, well-documented ways.

I’ve always found that idea oddly comforting. It feels like an honest description not just of functions, but of people. Of life. Of the universe.

We, too, are mostly well-behaved—predictable, learnable, explainable. We follow patterns. We build frameworks. We read articles titled “10 Principles of Something” because we believe, quite reasonably, that things can be understood.

And yet, each of us has our own poles.
Personal ones. Quiet ones. Some tender, some terrifying.
Places where logic fails and emotion takes over, or where memory refuses to resolve, or where a question just keeps echoing without answer.

The world has its poles too. Science has done a remarkable job explaining what’s going on—from the subatomic to the cosmic. But even now, there are things that remain stubbornly outside the equation. Consciousness. Time. Death. The part of your brain that lights up when you hear a certain piece of music and, for a moment, you feel both completely alive and totally unknowable.

So that’s what Meromorphy is. It’s a place to write from within the known, but always facing the edge of the unknown. It’s not a blog about math (though it might flirt with it now and then). It’s a space for science, life, innovation, and being human—being mostly coherent, but not entirely.
