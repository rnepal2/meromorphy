We often think of mystery as a void — a sudden absence of understanding. A rupture in an otherwise smooth field. But mathematics offers us a subtler picture: sometimes what looks like mystery is actually structure failing just slightly — in a way we can name, analyze, and even integrate.

*Understanding as a Ratio:* A meromorphic function, for instance, is a ratio of two holomorphic functions. On its own, it looks mostly well-behaved — smooth, differentiable, almost serene. But at isolated points, the denominator vanishes. The function spikes, becomes undefined. We call these poles. And yet, these aren’t wild breakdowns. They’re precise, knowable failures. We know why the spike occurs, where it happens, how it behaves around the edge. Even the disruption has a shape. Moreover, even at those poles, something remains — residues, a kind of fingerprint left by the singularities at the poles. Astonishingly, when we integrate such functions — when we try to understand them as a whole — we do it not by ignoring the singularities, but by summing the residues they leave behind. Their contributions are not errors to be discarded. They are essential to the total structure.

That, to me, feels more like life than most metaphors we’re given.

*The Shape of Breakdowns:* We are, each of us, quotient structures — built from rational parts, histories, thoughts, memories, assumptions, values — and yet prone to discontinuity at very specific places. Not everywhere. Just here and there. A trauma. A death. A loss of meaning. A crisis of belief. These don’t undo the whole function. But they mark its poles. And like the mathematical function, we don’t fall apart entirely at those points — we behave strangely, but still legibly. There’s something to be studied, something to be felt, even in our jaggedness. We remain coherent in every direction except the one we can’t quite approach.

*Grief and the Residue of Loss:* Take grief, for instance. When someone you love is alive, you know them. You understand their humor, their flaws, the weight of their silence, the rhythm of their breath in a room. Then they’re gone — and suddenly, the denominator vanishes. You are left with a numerator full of memory, habit, and love, divided by a complete and unresolvable absence. The singularity isn’t just the loss; it’s the impossibility of fitting that absence into the rest of your life. But you don’t stop living. You loop around it. You adapt your motion. You contour your choices around its presence. And in doing so, something remains: the residue of that loss — how it changes your posture in the world, how it sharpens your sense of time, how it softens you toward others’ suffering. The residue doesn’t vanish. It helps complete your arc.

*Hidden Structure of Mental Health:* Or take mental health — your own, or someone else’s. A person may be warm, articulate, engaged — and then suddenly overwhelmed, withdrawn, reactive. From the outside, it looks like a break in behavior. A pole. Something that doesn’t compute. But if you could see the hidden denominator — the accumulation of past experience, inner logic, and silent battles — you’d realize it’s not chaos. It’s structure you don’t yet see. And even when we can’t resolve it, we can often understand the residue it leaves — patterns of caution, bursts of empathy, the quiet strength of someone who’s survived. You might not be able to explain or “fix” the pole, but you can learn to integrate around it. To carry its contribution into your relationship with them. To see it not as a failure, but as a formation.

*What Lingers After the Pole:* This, to me, is the real gift of meromorphy — not just that singularities exist, but that they matter. That our most profound ruptures leave something behind that can be folded into meaning. That we are integrable, not because we are whole, but because we are shaped by where we are not. The residue of grief. The residue of trauma. The residue of joy so intense it frightened you. These are not footnotes to your life. They’re part of the equation.

And maybe that’s a kind of mercy. That our singularities don’t define our dysfunction, but our contribution. That even our breaks leave behind something measurable, meaningful — something that helps us complete the arc.
