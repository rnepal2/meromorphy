In mathematics, a meromorphic function is something that behaves—well, almost perfectly. It’s smooth, logical, beautifully structured… until it’s not. At certain isolated points, called poles, the function just loses its cool and shoots off to infinity. These aren’t flaws exactly. They’re part of the design. A meromorphic function is allowed to break, but only in very specific, well-documented ways.

I’ve always found that idea oddly comforting.

It feels like an honest description not just of functions, but of people. Of life. Of the world.

We, too, are mostly well-behaved—predictable, learnable, explainable. We follow patterns. We build frameworks. We read articles titled “10 Principles of Something” because we believe, quite reasonably, that things can be understood.

And yet... each of us has our own poles.
Personal ones. Quiet ones. Some tender, some terrifying.
Places where logic fails and emotion takes over, or where memory refuses to resolve, or where a question just keeps echoing without answer.

The world has its poles too. Science has done a remarkable job explaining what’s going on—from the subatomic to the cosmic. But even now, there are things that remain stubbornly outside the equation. Consciousness. Time. Death. The part of your brain that lights up when you hear a certain piece of music and, for a moment, you feel both completely alive and totally unknowable.

So that’s what Meromorphy is. It’s a place to write from within the known, but always facing the edge of the unknown. It’s not a blog about math (though it might flirt with it now and then). It’s a blog about science, life, innovation, and being human—being mostly coherent, but not entirely.

I plan to write about ideas that fascinate me, questions that won’t leave me alone, and patterns I think I see but don’t fully understand. Some posts might be deeply nerdy, others might be oddly reflective. I can’t promise consistency in theme, but I’ll try to be consistent in spirit: thoughtful, curious, and respectful of the fact that we are all a little broken, beautifully so.

If you’re the kind of person who likes standing at the edge of understanding and peering in—welcome. You’re in good company. Let’s see what we find.
