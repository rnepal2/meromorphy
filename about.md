## Meromorphy — Almost Understood. Beautifully Broken.

I am a Principal Data Scientist at Johnson & Johnson, where I lead initiatives within corporate functions to drive innovation through generative AI and data science. My work focuses on developing scalable machine learning solutions and leveraging real-world data to enhance clinical development and patient outcomes.

With a PhD in Physics from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln, my academic research delved into condensed matter physics, spintronics, and quantum information processing. This foundation has equipped me with a robust analytical skill set, enabling me to tackle complex problems at the intersection of science and technology.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoy exploring nature and reflecting on human experiences across cultures. Through this platform, I hope to share insights from my journey, discuss advancements in science, technology, and AI—or simply post random thoughts that I manage to put into words.
